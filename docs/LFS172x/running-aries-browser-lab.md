# Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa Demonstrations

Welcome to the demonstration section of the Linux Foundation's edX course LF172x, Introduction to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions: Indy, Aries and Ursa. In this section we have two demonstrations of Indy, Aries and Ursa technology.

## Mobile Agent Demonstration

### 2019.11.28: Due to a current version mismatch between the Streetcred app and IIWBook, this demonstration cannot be run at this time.  This note will be removed when the demo is working again - probably in the next few days.

In the first (called "IIWBook"), we use an Aries smartphone agent called Streetcred (from [Streetcred.id](Streetcred.id)) to interact with an Aries-based website (with Indy and Ursa embedded, of course) that issues you a verifiable credential, and a second site, also Aries-based, that requests a proof of the credential you have, and then issues you a second credential.

Want to install the Streetcred agent and run the demo yourself?  Click [here](https://vonx.io/how_to/iiwbook) for instructions on running through the IIWBook process. Please note that currently, there is **only an Apple IOS version** of the mobile agent. We're expecting an Android version to be ready Real Soon Now...

## Web Agent Demonstration

In the second demonstration, we build and run a web-based demo of interacting agents that goes through the story of Alice getting proof of her degree from Faber College in the form of a verifiable credential, and then using the verifiable credential in a proof that is part of a job application at ACME Corp. This is getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but Alice gets the job!
