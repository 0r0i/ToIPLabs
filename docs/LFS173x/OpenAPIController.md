# Lab: OpenAPI/Swagger Controller

In this lab, you are the controller. We'll use an OpenAPI/Swagger user interface to allow you to be an Aries agent controller. We'll use the same Alice/Faber demo, but this time you will provide the "business logic" to decide if Alice is going to accept Faber's offer of a credential.
