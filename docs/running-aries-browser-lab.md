# Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa Demonstrations

Welcome to the demonstration section of the Linux Foundation's edX course [LF172x, Hyperledger Identity: Indy, Aries and Ursa](). In this section we have two demonstrations of Indy, Aries and Ursa technology.

In the first (called "IIWBook"), you may install an Aries smartphone agent and use it to interact with an Aries-based website that issues you a verifiable credential, and a second site (also Aries-based - with Indy and Ursa embedded, of course) that requests a proof of the credential you have, and issues you a second credential.

In the second, you can run a web-based demo of interacting agents that takes you through the story of Alice getting proof of her degree from Faber College in the form of a verifiable credential, and then using the verifiable credential in a proof that is part of a job application at ACME Corp. This is getting a bit ahead of ourselves, but Alice gets the job!
